# Ai-Movement
Tutorial explaining how to make a character move by following another object

so we want an npc to follow our player when moving around
this can be easily achieved by a few lines of a code 
the prerequisite for this tutorial is to have a movable player and a scene set for it to move around

as an example, we can add a cube for the ai so we can test the code
simply add a 3d object to the scene, add a rigidbody as a component and a c# script

then we can open a script and add our code
