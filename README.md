# Ai-Movement
In this tutorial I will explain how to make an Ai object to follow your player!
So you would like to have an NPC in your 3D game that will follow you while you move?
This is a tutorial for you!
Although it is beginner friendly, I would like to add some prerequesites for you before making any further steps. 
You must have Unity and Microsoft Visual studio installed. I used Unity 2022.3.46f1 and Visual studio 2022, but any newer version should work too.
It is also recommended to know how to navigate through Unity and know the basics like adding a 3D object and components to the objects.
Another thing to note, this code is only applicable if one has a script for a player movement.


So we want an npc to follow our player when moving around
this can be easily achieved by a few lines of a code 
the prerequisite for this tutorial is to have a movable player and a scene set for it to move around

as an example, we can add a cube for the ai so we can test the code
simply add a 3d object to the scene, add a rigidbody as a component and a c# script

then we can open a script and add our code
